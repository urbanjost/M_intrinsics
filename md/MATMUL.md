## matmul

### **Name**

**matmul**(3) - \[TRANSFORMATIONAL\] numeric or logical matrix
multiplication

### **Syntax**
```fortran
    result=matmul(matrix_a,matrix_b)
```
```fortran
     function matmul(matrix_a, matrix_b)

     type(NUMERIC_OR_LOGICAL) :: matrix_a(..)
     type(NUMERIC_OR_LOGICAL) :: matrix_b(..)
     type(PROMOTED) :: matmul(..)
```
 - Arguments may be numeric (_integer_, _real_, or _complex_ )
   or _logical_ and must be one or two-dimensional arrays.
 - At least one argument must be rank two.
 - If one argument is _logical_, both must be _logical_.

### **Description**

 **matmul**(3) performs a matrix multiplication on numeric or logical
 arguments.

### **Arguments**

- **matrix_a**
  : A numeric or logical array with a rank of one or two.

- **matrix_b**
  : A numeric or logical array with a rank of one or two. The last
  dimension of **matrix_a** and the first dimension of **matrix_b**
  must be equal.

  Note that **matrix_a** and **matrix_b** may be different numeric
  types.

### **Returns**

####  **Numeric Arguments**

  If **matrix_a** and **matrix_b** are numeric the result is an
  array containing the conventional matrix product of **matrix_a**
  and **matrix_b**.

  First, for the numeric expression **C=matmul(A,B)**

   - Any vector **A(n)** is treated as a row vector **A(1,n)**.
   - Any vector **B(n)** is treated as a column vector **B(n,1)**.

#####  **Shape and Rank**

  The shape of the result can then be determined as the number of rows
  of the first matrix and the number of columns of the second; but if
  any argument is of rank one (a vector) the result is also rank one.
  Conversely when both arguments are of rank two, the result has a rank
  of two. That is ...

   + If **matrix_a** has shape [n,m] and **matrix_b** has shape [m,k],
     the result has shape [n,k].
   + If **matrix_a** has shape [m] and **matrix_b** has shape [m,k],
     the result has shape [k].
   + If **matrix_a** has shape [n,m] and **matrix_b** has shape [m],
     the result has shape [n].

#####  **Values**

  Then element **C(i,j)** of the product is obtained by multiplying
  term-by-term the entries of the ith row of **A** and the jth column
  of **B**, and summing these products. In other words, **C(i,j)**
  is the dot product of the ith row of **A** and the jth column of **B**.

#####  **Characteristics**

  The returned array will be promoted to the same type and kind as would
  result from multiplication between an element of each argument (like
  the multiplication operator (\*) had been used between the elements).

#### **Logical Arguments**

#####  **Values**

  If **matrix_a** and **matrix_b** are of type logical, the array elements
  of the result are instead:
```fortran
  Value_of_Element (i,j) = &
  ANY( (row_i_of_MATRIX_A) .AND. (column_j_of_MATRIX_B) )
```
#####  **Characteristics**

  The returned array is of the type and kind that results if any element of
  each argument had been operated on by the **.AND.** operator.

### **Examples**

Sample program:
```fortran
program demo_matmul
implicit none
integer :: a(2,3), b(3,2), c(2), d(3), e(2,2), f(3), g(2), v1(4),v2(4)
   a = reshape([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [2, 3])
   b = reshape([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60], [3, 2])
   c = [1, 2]
   d = [1, 2, 3]
   e = matmul(a, b)
   f = matmul(c,a)
   g = matmul(a,d)

   call print_matrix_int('A is ',a)
   call print_matrix_int('B is ',b)
   call print_vector_int('C is ',c)
   call print_vector_int('D is ',d)
   call print_matrix_int('E is matmul(A,B)',e)
   call print_vector_int('F is matmul(C,A)',f)
   call print_vector_int('G is matmul(A,D)',g)

   ! look at argument shapes when one is a vector
   write(*,'(" > shape")')
   ! at least one argument must be of rank two
   ! so for two vectors at least one must be reshaped
   v1=[11,22,33,44]
   v2=[10,20,30,40]

   ! these return a vector C(1:1)
   ! treat A(1:n) as A(1:1,1:n)
   call print_vector_int('Cd is a vector (not a scalar)',&
   & matmul(reshape(v1,[1,size(v1)]),v2))
   ! or treat B(1:m) as B(1:m,1:1)
   call print_vector_int('cD is a vector too',&
   & matmul(v1,reshape(v2,[size(v2),1])))

   ! or treat A(1:n) as A(1:1,1:n) and B(1:m) as B(1:m,1:1)
   ! but note this returns a matrix C(1:1,1:1) not a vector!
   call print_matrix_int('CD is a matrix',matmul(&
   & reshape(v1,[1,size(v1)]), &
   & reshape(v2,[size(v2),1])))
